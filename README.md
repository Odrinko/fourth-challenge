## My process

In this case I started by making an html component to insert it using Vanilla js, then I styled it with sass, and gave it the necessary functionalities with js. I also used Vite to get used to the workflow with the tool.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS
- Vanilla JS
- Vite 


### What I learned

I learned how to use js to modify the document object model, and how to use vite for do html templates for insert in the DOM, in the future I want to use typescript.
